## Mission
With the recent string of allegations and convictions of sexual assault in the film industry, viewers need to know whether the movies and tv they are consuming ends up supporting sexual assailants and predators. 

Hollywood Harassment provides a quick search of the possibly troubling background of a movie or tv show's director(s), writer(s), and major actor(s).

DISCLAIMER: Our algorithm is certainly not 100% accurate; it falsely accuses some and does not accuse others. It is inteded to be a tool to help raise awareness, but it isn't a complete list. Viewers are encouraged to do their own research; we serve as a starting point.

DISCLAIMER 2: The OMDb API that we implemented doesn't store the producer(s) of a movie or tv show.
